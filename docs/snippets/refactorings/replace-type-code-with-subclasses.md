# Apply: 35 — Replace Type Code with Subclasses

**Target state:** A 'kind' string field becomes a real subclass type; the type system enforces the legal set.

**Why apply it:** Compile-time checks that no kind is missed; per-kind behavior lives where it belongs.

**Tradeoff:** If only one or two switches exist on the type code, subclassing is over-design; combine with Replace Conditional with Polymorphism only when dispatch repeats.

```js
// Avoid:
class Employee {
  type; // 'engineer' | 'manager'
  bonus() {
    switch (this.type) {
      case 'engineer': return this.salary * 0.10;
      case 'manager':  return this.salary * 0.15 + this.reports.length * 100;
    }
  }
}

// Prefer:
class Employee {}
class Engineer extends Employee {
  bonus() { return this.salary * 0.10; }
}
class Manager extends Employee {
  bonus() { return this.salary * 0.15 + this.reports.length * 100; }
}
```

**Removes smells:** Repeated Switches, Primitive Obsession
